            However, although the complicated instrument panel had a unique aesthetic, it sacrificed the driver's accessibility to read information and make operations. In 1947, <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a800143.pdf">the U.S. Air Force studied 270 cases</a> of misreading and touching by pilots. It was found that the existing instrument panel design could cause serious psychological or physical interference to pilots. The conclusion of the study was that the possibility of such accidents could be eliminated or reduced through proper dashboard design, which inspired car manufacturers. After the 1970s, all functions were no longer displayed like a grocery store. It began to pay more attention to the relationship between people and cars, trying to complete the specified operation with the smallest hand movement range.

               Lamplight and windshield wipers were placed on both sides of the steering wheel, so that they could be controlled without removing hands from the steering wheel. The instrument panel concentrated warning lights on a line in front of the driver's license. A horizontally rotating roller was also used to display the speedometer and tachometer, and the characters were larger than before. However, it was a confusing and hard understanding design.

               The first production car to use an electronic dashboard, looked simple and modern. The numbers on the electronic digital dial continuously jumped and changed while driving. However, the characters 0, 6, 8, 9 were very similar, making the digital dial more difficult to see, and the driver had become accustomed to the traditional speedometer. So it soon returned to analog pointer type dashboard again.

               Since the 1990s, major automobile manufacturers and governments of various countries gradually realized the importance of airbags, which were later required by legislation to be equipped in cars.  Steering wheels that were once designed with all sorts of weirdness have also tended to be unified in order to accommodate airbags, gradually forming the layout of the car dashboard that we are familiar with today.

                The speedometer is in the most conspicuous place, as it is the most commonly used when driving. Other elements such as cooler temperature gauges and fuel gauges that need less attention during driving occupy a small area beside the speedometer. The controllers related to driving, such as wiper switch, steering switch, etc. are arranged on both sides of the steering wheel, where it is convenient to operate by turning or flipping the control lever. The mechanical control switch can give the driver timely and accurate feedback, normally without driver’s double confirmation, making driving much more safer.

              In recent years, there has also been a trend of further simplification of automobile dashboards, especially in some electric vehicles. A large touch screen in the center takes on the task of displaying all the information of the car. The adjustment of air conditioner, wiper, car light, etc. can also be realized by touch. The simplified central control system allows the driver to pay more attention to the road conditions. However, it makes a lot of drivers, who to the traditional modern dashboard, need to adapt.
